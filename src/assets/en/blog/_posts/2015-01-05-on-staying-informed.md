So another year passed and we've done a ton of stuff which I'd define as _cool_. Next to a lot of great projects and products, we started to think of ways to stay productive and motivated while also learning new stuff.

I'd like to recap a few things that came to my mind of what we did to stay informed about the newest tech we use to build our projects.

## Reading and discussing

A really easy way to keep track of new tech is just to subscribe to some old-school newsletters or follow special accounts on twitter or even idling in IRC channels to gather links and information. There are many blogs and articles that are highly interesting.

It's not like you should be checking all of these sources constantly to find new stuff, but it really helps if you at least glance over them at the end of the day. The next morning, you can share what you've found particularly interesting for yourself, one of your peers or some new technology that you'd see fit for the whole team. It helps a lot if you manage to get around discussing things you've read.

For us, if someone finds something interesting to discuss, we usually try to talk about it right after our stand-up meeting that we have every morning.

## Meetings and workshops

There are a lot of developers out there and many of them want to learn and share their experiences. It's really nice that there are more established companies out there that host developer meetups in their offices. It's like a lecture for free and a great way to get in touch with other people interested in the field you're working on.

At Campudus we always try to support learning, so transportation to said meetups will be paid by the company. It also doesn't matter if you stay late and won't make it to the stand-up next morning. It's like working somehow anyways. Go check out [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) and see what cool tech talks and user group meetings are being organized in your city.

There are also some cheap or even free workshops sometimes. They are usually worth it and tend to give you a lot more insights than you thought you'd get. Also, use the time to ask questions. The organizer / lecturer should be an expert or can at least give you a hint where to get your answer.

## Fun Friday

My personal favorite day of the week! We started this mainly as a motivation to do something completely different. We get some ideas and start hacking on them a whole day. Think of it as a hackathon with something where you try out a new tech, a new approach or just build something you like. Don't expect to have a finished product after doing a fun friday - it's more like a code retreat.

As there are always urgent customer requests, we figured that we somehow need to enforce us to do this more often. Starting this year, we plan to establish a fun friday every third week for the whole team. On all other fridays, it depends on who wants and is able to do something. So still fun friday, but optional. You don't want to 'force' people not to work, right?

During our previous fun fridays, we got a lot of experience which we could apply in our work projects. We can definitely recommend this concept - it helps a lot building something fun and small before using a new tech in production.

To recap from what I've learned most, it's always some hands-on experience and the discussions with other people.
