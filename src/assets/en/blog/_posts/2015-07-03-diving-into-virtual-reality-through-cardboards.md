During the latest fun friday, we had a lot of fun with virtual reality. Thanks to the guys at [dexper.io](http://dexper.io), we got a really nice customized POINTARCardboard plus two of their development prototypes to play with.

We had a lot of fun playing around with so many cardboard demos as you will see from the soon-to-come pictures.

## Google cardboard vs POINTARCardboard

But let's start from the beginning. Luckily, we got our hands on a [Google cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) by attending a JavaScript meetup in Munich.

During the Munich start up demo night, we got in touch with the guys from Dexperio and talked a bit about their products. After seeing their POINTARCardboard, we knew we had to check this out on one of our fun fridays.

That's how it started and let's have a quick overview over both cardboards:

### Building it

I remember putting the Google cardboard together was quite easy to set up due to their instructions on it. Just fold the numbers on each other and everything fell in place quite good. Not sure if I had to glue it myself or if it were already glued: The magnet-switch is a bit off for the glue, so I guess it was me lacking hardware skills. :) It feels a bit strange to use now, but it still works.

We got one already assembled POINTARCardboard and one assembled prototype. The one we put together ourselves was a prototype as well, but it was really easy to build just by looking at the ones we had. There is only one little gap where you have to put tape on. No problems with that and for a prototype.

### Phone sizes

The size is a real problem: Our newer smartphones with their large screens are just too big for the cardboard. You can't really wrap it around the phone or you'll end up powering it off or setting the volume up or down a lot of times as you need to use your hands to hold it in position..

Dexperio offers multiple sizes to compensate this problem. We had one size that was really good to fit the phones in. The two prototypes were not as good for all phones, but that's why they were just prototypes. As we could see with the good one (their real product), this was really nice to use for all the phones that fit in their slot. In the Dexperio case, you insert the phones through a slot on the top of the cardboard. A lot easier to put in and out as opposed to the official Google cardboard.

### Look and feel

When looking at the Google cardboard, you always just see it: It's just cardboard. You have to hold it in your hands to use it and while pressing it to your face you feel the cardboard. Looking at POINTAR, you don't even realize it's cardboard in the first place. The frame has rubber around it so you don't press cardboard directly on your face. You can also strap it around your head with the nice addon strap and you can use your hands for something else.

Another thing which makes the POINTARCardboard stand out is the customization. This makes it a lot better than the Google cardboard. Just think about having your company show products in VR at a trade fare - with branded VR headsets!
