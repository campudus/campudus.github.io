[Game Gorilla](http://demo.campudus.com) gives developers a nice API for peer-to-peer communication for their browsergames.

## Technical information

Its backend is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) on the [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) platform. With Vert.x we have access to rich real-time communication features that allow fast communication between browsers and the server.
