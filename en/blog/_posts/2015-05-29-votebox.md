It's been a while due to a reschedule in our fun fridays but this time, we had a look at a few different things:
* Flash to Canvas - how to do it and look at the available choices
* VoteBox - a tool to vote on our future Fun Friday topics

To get a bit overview on all these topics, we split our team into Flash2Canvas and VoteBox. 

We'll add a blog post with tips of our evaluation of the Flash to Canvas solutions as soon as one of our frontend devs finds some time to write something up.

## VoteBox
Almost every fun friday starts the same: We can't really decide which topic we should choose to cover this time. To cope with this problem, we decided to do a project where we can vote on things and, to get the most out of this day, do it with some fancy new technologies.

We already started working on projects with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) + [passport](http://passportjs.org/): This time, we switched roles and let the ones who did not build anything with these technologies yet learn them. Plus, we've added ECMAScript 6 (ES6) support through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and used [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) in combination with [underscore-db](https://github.com/typicode/underscore-db) as our small database.

So without further ado, let's have a look at our project and see what we've done:

### The concept
There will be a few REST endpoints for creating topics and ideas that you upvote to make a decision.

* `/topics` lists all topics - a topic may be "fun friday 20150522" or "name for project X", etc.
* `/topics/:topidId/ideas`, lists all ideas in that topic.
* `/topics/:topicId/ideas/:ideaId/votes` list the votes for this idea.

It will use the REST API best practices that Backbone/Ampersand etc. use:
* `GET` will list all entries or, with `id` set, a detailed entry.
* `POST` will create a new entry and does nothing when `id` is set.
* `PUT` will update an entry set by the `id`.
* `DELETE` will remove an entry set by the `id`.

### Gulp + Browserify + Babel
As always, we need to setup our project to see something. We are pretty confident with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) now and can get something set up with it pretty fast. To get ES6 working, we need to add a transpiler that converts ES6 code to ES5. There is [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (formerly known as 6to5). It seems that both should be working fine, but traceur needs a runtime, which we'd need to add. With Babel, we just need to add a transform to Browserify called [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify).

One problem that we didn't completely solve were source maps. There are generated source map files in our build now, but we couldn't really visualize them through our IDE and didn't want to stop looking for a solution: It may have been either the IDE or the source map or our usage. But as we couldn't find any more fitting examples to what we did, we didn't want to invest more time into this issue.

### Using ES6
In ES6, there are a lot of syntactical differences with regard to ES5. Writing functions with arrows, using classes and having `export` as a keyword that actually has a use felt strange at the beginning. The more we used it, the more sense it made though.

Even though the module system is a lot more thought out and static checks can be done before even starting the app, it somehow lost a bit of flexibility to the old `var x = require('x');` way. You could use a require wherever you wanted, thus allowing you to initialize things after you set up whatever was needed. There is`System.import('x', ...)` for dynamic module loading, but it's usage is not as nice as a synchronous call of `require()`.

### Using passport
[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) is a node module to authenticate users. It's main advantage is the authentication through providers like Google, Facebook etc. As our tool is only for internal use, we wanted to setup a local user storage as well and had a look into what is possible here.

### Using lowdb
[Lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) is a really fun way to interact with a file-based database. Like always, NodeJS modules and their APIs look great, are nice to use but at some point you get to some case that you just can't really figure out. We had trouble deleting elements from the topics database when using `remove`: It looks like this method tries to match only on the `id` attribute and is not really a matcher for objects as the "Remove songs" operation in their [readme](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb#operations) suggests. `removeWhere` is the method to match elements, if you're curious.

It took us a while to get to this conclusion so the final version of the backend API wasn't finished that day. We stopped without being able to add/remove/delete ideas to specific topics. Anyways, since the weekend sometimes urges us to code, we had some time to add some more stuff to it.

For simple applications with not too many users (and thus a single thread being able to handle all of them) and not too complex databases, lowdb might really work out as a usable tool - even though it's not really invented for production/live usage. For the intended usage in our case, this definitely was a nice choice.
