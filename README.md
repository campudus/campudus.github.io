# Campudus

1. Checkout branch `sources`.
2. `npm run dev` to start development mode with browser-sync.
3. Make your changes (`src/assets` for static files, `src/sass/*.scss` will publish to `/css/*.css` and `src/sass/_*.scss` is only for imports and doesn't get published itself)
4. `npm run deploy` to upload to GitHub pages branch (called `master` in this case).
